# Mini Search Engine

A very basic search engine from scratch in Python to learn the fundamentals of how systems like Google Search work â€” including crawling, indexing, and keyword-based ranking using TF-IDF.

I started building this tiny project because I was wondering how Safari always used Google Search as its default search engine, and how any search engine works. To understand it better, I decided to build this project to enhance my understanding of a search engine.

## Features

- Crawl webpages (using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`)
- Extract and clean up main text content
- Index documents using `TfidfVectorizer`
- Search and rank results by relevance (TF-IDF)
- Simple CLI (command-line interface) for querying

## What Does Each File Do?

`crawler.py`: This file handles downloading web pages and extracting readable text from HTML. In a real search engine, crawling is the first step: take Google as example, Googlebot (the crawler) is used to visit billions of pages to gather content.

`inderer.py`: This file builds the index: the core data structure that enables fast and relevant searches. We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to rank the results.

## First-time Setup Guide (Linux / MacOS)

1. Clone this repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JasonSu14/Mini_Search_Engine.git
    cd Mini_Search_Engine
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install required dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Deactivate when you're done

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## How to Run?

1. Run the code

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. Then type in a search query like:

   `Enter your search query: python language`

3. See the results

   Now it will return a list of the top matching pages and their relevance scores.

## For Developers

- Every time you want to work on the project: `source venv/bin/activate`

- When you're done: `deactivate`
